# Metachannels

## Why

* Being annoyed by **recommended** Videos instead of just seeing **related** Videos
* Being able to **organize** the channels you watch in a better way than just one pile of all kinds of different channels
* Not wanting to use a **Google** Account

## Website

You can test "Metachannels" [here](http://metachannels.ga/)
You can create Metachannels as a Guest. But if you want to edit them later, you need an account.
